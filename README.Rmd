# MyBrews

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MyBrews is to provide an overview over the authors homebrews (literally beer, not software). It is planned as a dashboard containing the brews done and some statistics and visualisations about the brews. The data comes from the authors brewfather database.

The following text is an automatically created filler text and will be updated when the basic functionality is created.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MyBrews from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FabianWag/MyBrews")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MyBrews)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
